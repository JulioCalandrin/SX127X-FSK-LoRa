------- Post-It -------

This is where I keep some notes
about the tasks I'm doing in
the library.

-----------------------

To-Do:

- Bandwidths should be typedefs (or not? Think about it)
- Remove unecessary macros and turn them into regular Masks (some lost on OCP and others on LoRa config)
- Remove magic numbers from bandwidths functions
- Optmize dynamic receive/transmitt functions for higher bitrates.
- Add remaining configuraton options.
- Create Enable/Disable functions for CRC Autoclear.
- Create Enable/Disable functions for Auto Restart RX.
- Create Enable/Disable functions for LNA Boost.
- Remove Magic Numbers from the PreambleDetector config.
- Remove Magic Numbers from DIO function selection.
- Go over the entire LoRa library to make it more like the FSK one.
- Add Implicit header mode in LoRa.

Make universal:

- Frequency ✓
- LNA ✓
- OCP ✓
- Power ✓
- PaRamp ✓
- OpMode ✓
- DIO ✓
- AGC - * Some registers are shared and others are not, kill me * - Do it later
